Hi Chad Wills.

How are you?

## I’d like to ask for your assistance.

While working as a Lead Installer, I identified an issue with how Saturday installs are scheduled. Right now, employees vote through group chats by sending "In" or "Out," but this system has several challenges:

1. Tracking availability is difficult.
   Example: Myk is available on October 26, and Andrew on November 2. Jude, our manager, has to remember these manually.

2. Building crews efficiently can be tricky.
   Example: Myk is the only person from his crew available this Saturday. Jude has to reassign team members, which takes extra time.

To address this, I created an app that manages employees' availability for Saturday installs.

## App Features:

View Saturdays a month ahead: Employees can vote and see who else is available.
Manager tools: Jude can view available employees, build crews, and store the information.

Please take a look at the screenshots (attached) to get a better sense of the app. Here’s the link to the app:

There are currently two branches: NJ South and NJ Central.

## What I Need from You:

- Review the app and screenshots.
- Meet with me to discuss the app's features in more detail.
- Coordinate with the IT Department to make the app official across the company.

I also have a list of future improvements, such as a manager’s calendar for scheduling crews. I’d love to discuss these ideas during our meeting.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and scheduling a meeting soon.

Best regards,
Leonid.
